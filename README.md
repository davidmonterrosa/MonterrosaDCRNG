- You are to build out a Random Name Generator.
- Pulling in data from a local JSON file, you will create a designed Random Name Generator.
- Have your application themed and make sure your list of names is the class plus the Instructors.
- You also need to have a section that shows the previous 5 names that were pulled from your Random Name Generator.

> Comments: I like how you displayed your data in card format and that you were able to have to previous list not include the current person. I am unsure if all the data in the JSON file is needed on the site but it is nice that you have it if you need it. All in all your site works great. Keep up the good work.
